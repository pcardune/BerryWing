# supradrone
A sandbox to build an autonomous drone in.


### What I'm thinking:
I have this Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.  It has a wifi USB dongle and a 64 GB micro SD card.

I'm wondering...can I put this thing in the air? autonomously?



### Things I have done so far:

Bought these items:
* [Breadboard, petentionometer switches, ultrasonic sensor, LCD screen, LEDs.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06W54L7B5)
