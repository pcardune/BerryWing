### Day 1
Breadboard kit arrived.  After much gnashing of teeth I learned that GPIO doesn't switch to hot, but instead switches to ground.  That took much longer than it should've - mostly because I don't have my voltmeter with me.  After all that I was able to flash an LED (```helloworld_LED.py```)

After that things progressed quickly.  I was able to hook up the ultrasonic sensor to the servo (```helloworld_ultraservo.py```).  As the "ground" approaches the ultrasonic sensor, the servo changes position (to adjust flight path accordingly).

### Day 2:
There are some interesting Raspberry Pi drones already out there:
* [Pi Zero Plane](https://www.instructables.com/id/Pi-Zero-Plane-a-150-Smart-Fixed-Wing-Drone-With-th/) (this is the closest to what I'm looking to build).
* [DIY FPV Drone 4-axis Quadcopter Kit S500 Frame + FS-i6 Flight Control + Raspberry Pi + 920KV Motor + GPS](https://www.amazon.com/4-axis-Quadcopter-Flight-Control-Raspberry/dp/B07R7DLQGK) on Amazon.
* [Pi0drone: A $200 Smart Drone with the Pi Zero](https://www.hackster.io/12590/pi0drone-a-200-smart-drone-with-the-pi-zero-4fec08)
* [Instructables Raspberry Pi Drone](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Drone-Pi/)
* [Â£300 autonomous drone with DJI Flamewheel & Ardupilot](https://medium.com/the-reading-room/how-to-build-an-autonomous-drone-for-less-than-300-80ebeb2b1db8)

There are also some interesting flying platforms:
* [2 meter wingspan, 670g payload](https://www.banggood.com/Believer-1960mm-Wingspan-EPO-Twin-Motor-Aerial-Survey-Aircraft-FPV-Platform-Mapping-RC-Airplane-KIT-p-1178800.html)
* [1.5m wingspan, "self correcting tendencies"](https://www.readymaderc.com/products/details/strix-stratosurfer-pnp)
* [2m wingspan, more advanced drone, unknown payload](https://www.readymaderc.com/products/details/rmrc-anaconda-kit)
* Long term we'll probably need something with a 3-4m wingspan [like the Penguin](https://www.uavfactory.com/product/46) (10kg payload).

We also need to start thinking about pitot tubes.  Looks like there's some prior art on an Arduino [over at MarkerPortal](https://makersportal.com/blog/2019/02/06/arduino-pitot-tube-wind-speed-theory-and-experiment).  There's also [this documentation](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/airspeed.html) over at [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html).

Also... Ardupilot.  Holy smokes.  It's now the closest thing to the product we've considered.  The have a list of ready-to-fly options...

Autonomous power line inspections with image processing might be a possible use case...[see this thread with my cousin Jeremy](https://github.com/srosro/BerryWing/blob/master/assets/autonomous-power-line-monitoring-use-case.png?raw=true).


### Day 4
I was having problems getting the BerryIMUv2-10DOF and get it to respond (even though the device was detected):

```
$ sudo i2cdetect -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1c -- -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6a -- -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 77
```

```
sudo python ./python-BMP180-temperature-pressure/bmp180.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./python-BMP180-temperature-pressure/bmp180.py", line 20, in <module>
    (chip_id, version) = bus.read_i2c_block_data(addr, 0xD0, 2)
IOError: [Errno 121] Remote I/O error
```

Found the problem: pins were not making secure contact with the board.  Wedging a watch strap under the board to push it towards the pins fixed the issue:

![Wiring diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srosro/BerryWing/master/assets/watch-wedge.png)

```
$ sudo python ./python-BMP180-temperature-pressure/bmp180.py
Chip Id: 88 Version: 0

```

Now I need to work on calibration...as it's not 82.7 deg C in here...

# Packages I'm installing that might be important.
I should probably put these into a python environment...

* lsm9ds1-rjg (actually, probably not needed)

Also, this stuff:

```
history | grep apt-get

6  sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
8  sudo apt-get install vim
29  sudo apt-get install i2c-tools libi2c-dev python-smbus
48  sudo apt-get install python-smbus
145  sudo apt-get install python-pip
171  sudo apt-get install cmake
172  sudo apt-get install python-dev
171  sudo apt-get install cmake
172  sudo apt-get install python-dev
251  apt-get search pip
255  apt-get install python3-pip
256  sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
